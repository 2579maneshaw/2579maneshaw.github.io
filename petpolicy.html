      <h1>Pet Policy</h1>

      <div class="notice">
        <strong>No animals allowed.</strong>
        To protect guests with animal allergies, this property is maintained as an animal-free home.
      </div>

      <p>
        We fully respect and understand the importance of service animals and the vital role they play for many guests.
        At the same time, through personal experience, we are also aware that there is a significant lack of vacation rentals
        that can safely accommodate guests with serious animal allergies.
      </p>

      <p>
        For this reason, we have chosen to be one of the few homes specifically dedicated to providing an <strong>animal-free environment</strong>.
        Our goal is to keep this property safe and comfortable for guests who cannot stay in homes that have had animals due to
        allergy-related health risks. To maintain this standard, we enforce a <strong>strict no-animals policy</strong>,
        including service animals.
      </p>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <p>
        We truly do not want to lose your business, and we respect that every guest has different needs. If this policy does not work for you,
        we completely understand and encourage you to choose a property that better accommodates your requirements. This allows us, in turn,
        to serve another group of guests whose needs are often overlooked.
      </p>

      <p class="small">
        Our intent is not to exclude, but to ensure that this home remains a safe and reliable option for travelers with animal allergies.
      </p>
